* Namespaces are isolated environments that functionally exist as "Vaults within a Vault." They have separate login paths and support creating and managing data isolated to their namespace.
* Telemetry information can be streamed directly from Vault to a range of metrics aggregation solutions.
* **tokens** are the default auth method in Vault and cannot be disabled.
* The revocation can happen manually via the API, via the ```vault lease revoke``` cli command, the user interface (UI) under the Access tab, or automatically by Vault.
